# GMSI
GeX's Map Script Interpreter.

compile (drag n drop).bat requires javac to be in environment variables. It uses the original GMSI.jar (GMSI_do_not_change.jar) to recompile the code. The compiled class file is placed in the same folder as the input file.

You need to replace the old .class files manually in your GMSI.jar.
